## About The Project

Compiling a travel list is easy! Just state what you don't want to leave at home and how much of it. Add it to the list and simply tick off what you put in! Summarized below, you can see how many things you should not forget. Don't you want to pack something? Then simply delete it from the list!

Pack easily!

## Built in

3. CSS
4. Javascript

## What I learned

I started learning React with this little project. It helped a lot in understanding the state and how it works. It's just a small app, but I've learned a lot and this project is just the first of many. I am constantly learning and developing, and even if we only write such small applications, it is still possible to achieve huge progress with it.
